Create a list, , of  empty sequences, where each sequence is indexed from  to . The elements within each of the  sequences also use -indexing.
Create an integer, , and initialize it to .
The  types of queries that can be performed on your list of sequences () are described below:
Query: 1 x y
Find the sequence, , at index  in .
Append integer  to sequence .
Query: 2 x y
Find the sequence, , at index  in .
Find the value of element  in  (where  is the size of ) and assign it to .
Print the new value of  on a new line

/*
 * For each type  query, print the updated value of  on a new line.
